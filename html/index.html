<p>Note that we would only get to this point after a client has successfully connected to our server. 
This code initializes the buffer using the bzero() function, and then reads from the socket. Note that 
the read call uses the new file descriptor, the one returned by accept(), not the original file
descriptor returned by socket(). Note also that the read() will block until there is something for 
it to read in the socket, i.e. after the client has executed a write().</p>
